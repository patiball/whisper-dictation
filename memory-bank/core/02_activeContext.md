# Active Context

**Current Focus:** ðŸŸ¢ **Addressing Code Review Feedback**

**Status:** A pre-merge code review has been completed, comparing the local branch against the original `upstream/main`. The review identified several key areas for improvement before merging.

**Active Epic:** Code Quality and Robustness Refinements

- **Priority:** High
- **Goal:** To address the findings from the code review to improve code quality, maintainability, and robustness.

**Immediate Priorities:**

1.  **Fix Overly Broad Exception Handling**
    -   **Problem:** The code uses `except:` and `except Exception:`, which can hide bugs and make debugging difficult.
    -   **Action:** Replace broad exceptions with specific ones and log errors appropriately.

2.  **Refactor Global State**
    -   **Problem:** The application relies heavily on global variables, making it hard to test and reason about.
    -   **Action:** Encapsulate state within an application class to make state management explicit.

3.  **Standardize Code and Comments**
    -   **Problem:** The code has inconsistencies, such as comments in multiple languages and mixed quote styles.
    -   **Action:** Standardize all comments to English and apply a consistent code format (e.g., using `black` or `ruff format`).
