# Active Context

**Current Focus:** 🧪 **Test Infrastructure Repair - Verification Complete, Tasks Added to User Stories**

**Status:** 🟡 **VERIFICATION COMPLETE - FIXES INTEGRATED INTO USER STORIES**
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (blocks all development until all 5 user stories fully completed)
- **5 User Stories with Integrated Tasks:** ✅ VERIFIED INFRASTRUCTURE + ADDED MISSING TASKS
  - [15-01-00] Thread Cleanup and Timeouts - ✅ VERIFIED - No hangs, 17/17 tests pass
  - [15-02-00] Logging Handler Pollution + File Persistence - ✅ PARTIALLY VERIFIED + 🆕 [15-02-04] task added
  - [15-03-00] Subprocess Resource Cleanup + Missing Import - ✅ VERIFIED + 🆕 [15-03-04] task added
  - [15-04-00] Infinite Thread Hangs + Missing Import - ✅ VERIFIED + 🆕 [15-04-03] task added
  - [15-05-00] Configuration & Environment Isolation + Variable Scoping - ✅ VERIFIED + 🆕 [15-05-04] task added
- **Verification Results (151.75 seconds, 64 passed, 25 failed):**
  - ✅ Infrastructure fixes working correctly
  - ❌ Found: Missing imports in integration tests (10 failures) → [15-03-04] & [15-04-03] tasks
  - ❌ Found: Logging file persistence issue (8 failures) → [15-02-04] task
  - ❌ Found: max_bytes variable scoping issue (1 failure) → [15-05-04] task
  - Pre-existing: Other test failures (7 failures - out of scope)
- **Updated Estimates:** Total now 45+60+45+35+40 = 225 minutes (was 240 min, now more accurate)
- **Next Step:** Implement 4 new tasks to complete Epic 15

**Completed Components:**
1. ✅ **[13-05-00]** Lessons Learned Tests Suite (30-40 min) - ALL TASKS DONE
2. ✅ **[13-04-00]** Enhanced Logging & Diagnostics (15-20 min) - ALL TASKS DONE
3. ✅ **[13-01-00]** Lock File + Signal Handling (20-25 min) - ALL TASKS DONE
4. ✅ **[13-02-00]** Microphone Proactive Check (10-15 min) - ALL TASKS DONE
5. ✅ **[13-03-00]** Audio Stream Watchdog (30-40 min) - ALL TASKS DONE

**🎉 EPIC COMPLETION: Lessons Learned Foundation - 100% DONE!**
**Total: 20 of 20 tasks completed (100%)**
**Application now has production-grade stability!**

**After Test Infrastructure Repair (Next Priorities):**
1. ⏱️ **Transcription Timestamps** (specs/[10-00-00]_transcription_timestamps.md)
   - Add timestamps to all messages for clearer UX feedback
   - Priority: High, Estimate: 30-45 minutes

2. 🔧 **macOS Portability** (specs/[09-00-00]_macos_portability_improvements.md)
   - C++ version support for Intel Macs (hard-coded Apple Silicon paths)
   - Priority: High, Estimate: 30-45 minutes

3. 📝 **Documentation Translation** (English)
   - Status: Deferred (will prioritize after test infrastructure + core features)
   - Scope: ~10 files (130KB), focus on README and architecture

**Analysis Artifacts:**
- See: `memory-bank/lessons_learned/test_infrastructure_conflicts_analysis.md` - Comprehensive report of all 7 critical issues
