Last Update: 2025-10-31

**Current Status:** ✅ **Production Ready** - Enhanced stability with lock file, signal handling, logging, microphone checks & audio watchdog

## Recent Completed Milestones

### ✅ Lessons Learned Foundation - Stability & Reliability (2025-10-31) - COMPLETED

**Enhanced Logging & Diagnostics:**
- RotatingFileHandler with 5MB max size, 5 backup files
- Configurable log levels (--log-level) and custom log file paths (--log-file)
- Event logging for startup, shutdown, recording, transcription, errors
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED - All 3 tasks done

**Lock File + Signal Handling:**
- PID-based lock file mechanism (~/.whisper-dictation.lock)
- Multiple instance prevention with proper error handling
- Signal handlers for SIGINT/SIGTERM graceful shutdown
- Cleanup order: stop recording → close audio → remove lock
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED - All 3 tasks done

**Microphone Proactive Check:**
- Startup microphone access verification using sounddevice
- Early detection of permission issues and device availability
- Graceful degradation with user-friendly error messages
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED - All 2 tasks done

**Audio Stream Watchdog:**
- Background monitoring thread with heartbeat tracking
- Stall detection (>10s timeout) and automatic stream recovery
- Integration with recording loop and graceful shutdown
- Comprehensive test suite (17/17 tests passing)
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED - All 4 tasks done

**Test Infrastructure:**
- Comprehensive test suite for all stability features
- Unit tests, integration tests, and manual test procedures
- CI/CD configuration and test fixtures
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED - All 4 tasks done

### ✅ Audio Quality Fixes (2025-10-21) - COMPLETED

**Python Version:**
- Audio clipping fix (frames_per_buffer=512, warm-up buffers, auto-fallback)
- Status: Already implemented

**C++ Version:**
- Audio pipeline: Start sound delayed 0.1s to prevent interference
- Language detection: Fixed with `-l auto` flag for correct Polish transcription
- Translation mode: Verified defaults to transcription (not translation)
- Status: Production-ready with correct output

### ✅ Whisper.cpp Quality Improvements (2025-10-21) - COMPLETED

Core issues addressed:
- Audio cutting (sound interference)
- Language detection (forcing first language)
- Translation mode (missing transcription flag)

For implementation details see: `specs/[02-00-00]_whisper_cpp_quality_fix.md` and `specs/[08-00-00]_audio_clipping_warmup_fix.md`

## Current Sprint: Lessons Learned Foundation (2025-10-25)

**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Focus**: Stability and reliability foundation from macos-dictate

### Sprint Goals:
- **Lessons Learned Foundation Epic** - specs/[13-00-00]_lessons_learned_foundation.md
  - Status: Epic specification ready for implementation
  - Scope: 5 User Stories (Lock file, Signal handling, Microphone check, Watchdog, Logging, Tests)
  - Approach: TDD-first implementation in 5 phases
  - Changes: Both whisper-dictation.py and whisper-dictation-fast.py
  - Estimate: 135-170 minutes (2.5-3 hours)
