Last Update: 2025-10-31

**Current Status:** ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUE** - Test suite hangs due to infrastructure issues. Stability features complete but test infrastructure must be repaired first.

## Recent Completed Milestones

### âœ… Lessons Learned Foundation - Stability & Reliability (2025-10-31) - COMPLETED

**Enhanced Logging & Diagnostics:**
- RotatingFileHandler with 5MB max size, 5 backup files
- Configurable log levels (--log-level) and custom log file paths (--log-file)
- Event logging for startup, shutdown, recording, transcription, errors
- Status: âœ… COMPLETED - All 3 tasks done

**Lock File + Signal Handling:**
- PID-based lock file mechanism (~/.whisper-dictation.lock)
- Multiple instance prevention with proper error handling
- Signal handlers for SIGINT/SIGTERM graceful shutdown
- Cleanup order: stop recording â†’ close audio â†’ remove lock
- Status: âœ… COMPLETED - All 3 tasks done

**Microphone Proactive Check:**
- Startup microphone access verification using sounddevice
- Early detection of permission issues and device availability
- Graceful degradation with user-friendly error messages
- Status: âœ… COMPLETED - All 2 tasks done

**Audio Stream Watchdog:**
- Background monitoring thread with heartbeat tracking
- Stall detection (>10s timeout) and automatic stream recovery
- Integration with recording loop and graceful shutdown
- Comprehensive test suite (17/17 tests passing)
- Status: âœ… COMPLETED - All 4 tasks done

**Test Infrastructure:**
- Comprehensive test suite for all stability features
- Unit tests, integration tests, and manual test procedures
- CI/CD configuration and test fixtures
- Status: âœ… COMPLETED - All 4 tasks done

### âœ… Audio Quality Fixes (2025-10-21) - COMPLETED

**Python Version:**
- Audio clipping fix (frames_per_buffer=512, warm-up buffers, auto-fallback)
- Status: Already implemented

**C++ Version:**
- Audio pipeline: Start sound delayed 0.1s to prevent interference
- Language detection: Fixed with `-l auto` flag for correct Polish transcription
- Translation mode: Verified defaults to transcription (not translation)
- Status: Production-ready with correct output

### âœ… Whisper.cpp Quality Improvements (2025-10-21) - COMPLETED

Core issues addressed:
- Audio cutting (sound interference)
- Language detection (forcing first language)
- Translation mode (missing transcription flag)

For implementation details see: `specs/[02-00-00]_whisper_cpp_quality_fix.md` and `specs/[08-00-00]_audio_clipping_warmup_fix.md`

### ðŸ”´ Test Infrastructure Issues Discovered (2025-10-31) - IN PROGRESS

**Critical Issues Blocking All Development:**
- Thread cleanup anti-patterns cause 80+ second test hangs
- Logging handler pollution causes 11 tests to interfere with each other
- Subprocess resource leaks cause 50+ second hangs
- Infinite thread.join() calls can hang tests indefinitely
- Conflicting pytest.ini and pyproject.toml configuration
- Test suite takes 160+ seconds or hangs indefinitely (unacceptable)

**Impact**: Cannot reliably run tests for new features. Test infrastructure must be fixed first.

**Action Plan**: Implement [15-00-00] Test Infrastructure Repair Epic
- [15-01-00] Thread Cleanup Fix (2/3 difficulty)
- [15-02-00] Logging Handler Pollution Fix (2/3 difficulty)
- [15-03-00] Subprocess Resource Cleanup (1/3 difficulty)
- [15-04-00] Infinite Thread Hangs Fix (1/3 difficulty)
- [15-05-00] Configuration & Environment Isolation (1/3 difficulty)
- Estimate: 240 minutes (4 hours)

**Analysis**: See `memory-bank/lessons_learned/test_infrastructure_conflicts_analysis.md` for comprehensive report

## Current Sprint: Test Infrastructure Repair (2025-10-31)

**Priority**: CRITICAL (BLOCKING)
**Focus**: Fix test suite hangs and configuration conflicts

### Sprint Goals:
- **Test Infrastructure Repair Epic** - specs/[15-00-00]_test_infrastructure_repair.md
  - Status: Specifications ready for implementation
  - Scope: 5 User Stories (Thread cleanup, Logging isolation, Subprocess cleanup, Thread joins, Config)
  - Approach: Fix each critical issue in priority order
  - Changes: Test files only (conftest.py, test_*.py, pytest.ini, pyproject.toml)
  - Estimate: 240 minutes (4 hours total)
  - Difficulty Breakdown: 2 Medium (45+50 min), 3 Easy (30+40+35 min)
