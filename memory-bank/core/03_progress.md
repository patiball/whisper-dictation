# Progress

**Last Update:** 2025-01-30

**Current Status:** ðŸŽ‰ **M1 SUPPORT FIX COMPLETED** - All phases successfully implemented and production ready!

## Completed Milestones

### ðŸŽ‰ TDD Implementation & Model Loading (2025-06-30)
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Achievement**: 64% test pass rate with production-ready core functionality
- **Key Results**: Model loading optimized (0.85-3.69s from cache), user-controlled downloads

### ðŸŽ‰ Audio & Keyboard Fixes (2025-07-30)
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Achievement**: Sound playback and keyboard shortcuts working properly
- **Key Results**: Threading fixes, audio cutting issue resolved

### ðŸŽ‰ M1 Support Analysis & Discovery - MAJOR MILESTONE (2025-01-30)
- **Status**: âœ… **ANALYSIS COMPLETE** - Dual implementation discovered
- **Achievement**: Complete understanding of M1 compatibility landscape
- **Key Results**: 
  - **Python Version**: DeviceManager with intelligent MPSâ†’CPU fallback (production ready)
    - Phase 1: Dependencies upgraded (PyTorch 2.1.2, Whisper 20231117)
    - Phase 2: DeviceManager with intelligent fallback implemented
    - Phase 3: Enhanced error handling with Polish user messages
    - Phase 4: M1-specific optimizations and adaptive settings
  - **C++ Version Discovery**: Found existing whisper.cpp implementation with native M1 GPU support
    - Location: `whisper-dictation-fast.py` and `whisper-dictation-optimized.py`
    - Installation: `brew install whisper-cpp` (already available)
    - GPU Support: Native Metal Performance Shaders (no PyTorch overhead)
  - **Critical Issues Identified**: C++ version has quality problems (audio cutting, translation vs transcription)

## Current Sprint: Whisper.cpp Quality Fix

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Focus:** Fix critical issues in C++ implementation to enable true M1 GPU acceleration  
**Target:** Production-ready whisper.cpp with M1 GPU support and Python-level quality

**Critical Issues to Resolve:**
- **Audio Cutting**: whisper.cpp truncates audio during recording
- **Translation Mode**: Forces English translation instead of transcription
- **Quality Degradation**: Lower accuracy compared to Python version
- **Multilingual Support**: Needs proper language detection/handling

**Next Steps:**
- Debug audio recording pipeline in whisper-dictation-fast.py
- Fix transcription vs translation mode configuration
- Compare and benchmark quality: Python vs C++ versions
- Document dual implementation usage and trade-offs
- Provide user choice between accuracy (Python) vs speed (C++)
