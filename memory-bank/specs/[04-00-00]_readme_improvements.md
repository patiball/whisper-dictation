# Feature: README.md Structure & UX Improvements

**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: Medium
**Complexity**: Simple
**Estimate**: 30-45 minutes
**Jira Story**: [MSB-3](https://metal-scribe.atlassian.net/browse/MSB-3) - README.md Structure & UX Improvements

## Overview
Improve README.md structure and user experience to help new users quickly choose the right implementation and get started without confusion. Focus on practical improvements over comprehensive documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add Quick Start Guide section with immediate copy-paste commands for M1/M2 and Intel Macs
- [ ] Add "Which Version Should I Choose?" decision matrix with clear recommendations
- [ ] Reorganize sections in logical order: Quick Start → Decision Matrix → Prerequisites → Installation → Usage
- [ ] Add Troubleshooting section with common issues (permissions, whisper-cpp, audio detection)
- [ ] Remove redundant information and improve flow for new users
- [ ] Ensure all code examples are copy-pasteable and work out of the box
- [ ] Keep focus on README.md only - no separate docs/ directory needed

## Expected Structure
```markdown
# Title + Description
## Table of Contents
## Quick Start Guide          ← NEW
## Which Version to Choose?    ← NEW
## Prerequisites              ← IMPROVED (already done)
## Installation
## Usage
## Setting as Startup Item
## Troubleshooting            ← NEW
## Test Files
## Running Tests
```

## File Changes Required
- `README.md` (major restructure and additions)

## Integration Points
Improved README will serve as the single source of truth for users. No additional documentation infrastructure needed - keep it simple and focused on user experience.

## Implementation Notes
- Target users: developers wanting to quickly evaluate and use the tool
- Priority: getting started fast over comprehensive documentation
- Approach: practical examples over theoretical explanations
