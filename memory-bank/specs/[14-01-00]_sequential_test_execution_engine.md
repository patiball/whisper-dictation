# User Story: Sequential Test Execution Engine

**ID**: 14-01-00
**Epic**: [14-00-00] Sequential Test Runner for Human-Friendly Execution
**Priority**: High
**Complexity**: Medium
**Estimate**: 15-20 minutes

## User Story
As a developer, I want tests to execute sequentially with clear progress tracking, so that I can monitor test execution and identify failures immediately during development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tests execute one at a time (no parallel execution)
- [ ] Progress indicator shows current test number and total count (e.g., "3/9")
- [ ] Each test execution displays test name and category
- [ ] Execution time is measured and displayed for each test
- [ ] Test runner tracks and reports total execution time
- [ ] Script stops execution immediately when a test fails (configurable)
- [ ] Option to continue execution despite failures for full analysis

## Behavior Examples

### Sequential Execution with Failure:
```
[1/9] üîí Lock File Tests (test_lock_file.py)...
‚úÖ PASSED (2.3s) - 4/4 tests

[2/9] üé§ Microphone Check Tests (test_microphone_check.py)...
‚úÖ PASSED (1.1s) - 3/3 tests

[3/9] üêï Audio Watchdog Tests (test_audio_watchdog.py)...
‚ùå FAILED (0.8s) - Test: test_stall_detection_timeout
   Error: AssertionError in test_stall_detection_timeout
   Location: tests/test_audio_watchdog.py:145

‚ö†Ô∏è  STOPPING ON FAILURE (use --continue to run all tests)
```

### Sequential Execution with Continue Flag:
```
$ python scripts/run_sequential_tests.py --continue

[3/9] üêï Audio Watchdog Tests (test_audio_watchdog.py)...
‚ùå FAILED (0.8s) - Test: test_stall_detection_timeout
   Error: AssertionError in test_stall_detection_timeout
   Location: tests/test_audio_watchdog.py:145

‚ö†Ô∏è  CONTINUING DESPITE FAILURE

[4/9] üìù Logging Tests (test_logging.py)...
‚úÖ PASSED (1.5s) - 3/3 tests
```

## Key Assumptions
- **Assumption**: Sequential execution time is acceptable for development workflow
- **Validation**: Current test suite completes in under 2 minutes when run sequentially
- **Assumption**: Developers prefer immediate failure notification over batch processing
- **Validation**: Stop-on-failure behavior matches typical development debugging patterns

## Related Tasks
- [14-01-01] Create sequential test runner script foundation
- [14-01-02] Implement pytest sequential execution wrapper
- [14-01-03] Add progress tracking and timing functionality
- [14-01-04] Implement failure handling and continue-on-failure option

## Implementation Context (Not Part of Spec)

**Current Location**: New script `scripts/run_sequential_tests.py`
**Key Variables**: Test execution order, timing data, failure tracking
**Note**: These implementation details change. The spec above remains stable.
