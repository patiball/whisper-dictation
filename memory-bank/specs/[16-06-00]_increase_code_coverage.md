# User Story: Increase Code Coverage
**ID**: 16-06-00
**Epic**: [16-00-00] Post-Epic 15 Test Infrastructure & Functional Fixes
**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimate**: 60-90 minutes

## User Story
As a developer, I want the test suite to meet the project's code coverage requirements, so that we can maintain code quality and reduce the risk of regressions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The `pytest --cov` command completes successfully without a `Coverage failure` error.
- [ ] Total code coverage is 70% or higher.

## File Changes Required
- This will require adding new tests across the test suite. The initial focus should be on the files with the lowest coverage:
  - `recorder.py` (44%)
  - `transcriber.py` (58%)
  - `mps_optimizer.py` (65%)
- New test files may be created or existing ones (`test_*.py`) may be expanded.
