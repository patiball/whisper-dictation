# User Story: Stabilize Logging Tests
**ID**: 16-03-00
**Epic**: [16-00-00] Post-Epic 15 Test Infrastructure & Functional Fixes
**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: High
**Estimate**: 30-45 minutes

## User Story
As a developer, I want all logging-related tests to pass reliably, so that I can trust the application's logging and diagnostic capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All tests in `tests/test_logging.py` pass.
- [ ] The issue where log content appears empty during assertions (e.g., `assert "DEBUG" in ""`) is resolved.
- [ ] The `test_logging_concurrent_access` test correctly asserts the number of messages logged from multiple threads.

## File Changes Required
- `tests/test_logging.py`: Review and refactor the log capturing mechanism. The current fixture might be polluted or reset before assertions are made.
- `conftest.py`: Check the scope and implementation of any logging-related fixtures.
