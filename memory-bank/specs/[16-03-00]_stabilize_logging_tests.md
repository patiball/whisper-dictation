# User Story: Stabilize Logging Tests
**ID**: 16-03-00
**Epic**: [16-00-00] Post-Epic 15 Test Infrastructure & Functional Fixes
**Status**: Implemented
**Priority**: High
**Estimate**: 30-45 minutes

## User Story
As a developer, I want all logging-related tests to pass reliably, so that I can trust the application's logging and diagnostic capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All tests in `tests/test_logging.py` pass.
- [x] The issue where log content appears empty during assertions (e.g., `assert "DEBUG" in ""`) is resolved.
- [x] The `test_logging_concurrent_access` test correctly asserts the number of messages logged from multiple threads.

## Solution Summary
- **Problem:** Tests were interfering with each other by modifying the global (root) logger state. The `test_logging_concurrent_access` test was failing because it was not capturing logs correctly.
- **Solution:**
  1.  Created a new `configured_logger` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` to provide a clean, isolated, named logger with its own temporary file handler for each test.
  2.  Refactored all tests in `tests/test_logging.py` to use this new fixture, removing manual and error-prone logging setup and teardown.
  3.  This ensures each test runs in a clean environment, fixing the concurrent access test and improving overall test suite stability.

## File Changes Required
- `tests/test_logging.py`: Refactored all tests to use the `configured_logger` fixture.
- `tests/conftest.py`: Added the `configured_logger` fixture.
