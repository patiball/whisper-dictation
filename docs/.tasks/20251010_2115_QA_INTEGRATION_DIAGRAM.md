# Task: QA Review of System Integration Diagram

## Objective
Review ONLY the newly created SYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md file to ensure diagram quality and accuracy.

## File to Review
`/Users/mprzybyszewski/dev/ai-projects/whisper-dictation/docs/SYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md`

## Review Criteria

### 1. Mermaid Diagram Syntax
- [ ] All 7 diagrams have correct Mermaid syntax
- [ ] Diagrams will render properly in GitHub/viewers
- [ ] No syntax errors in graph definitions
- [ ] Subgraphs are properly formatted
- [ ] Styling/classes are applied correctly

### 2. Technical Accuracy
- [ ] All components are represented (DeviceManager, Recorder, Transcriber, etc.)
- [ ] Data flow is correct (Microphone → PyAudio → Recorder → Transcriber → Output)
- [ ] Dependencies are accurately shown
- [ ] Component relationships match actual codebase
- [ ] Technology stack is correct (PyAudio, Whisper, pykeyboard)

### 3. Clarity & Completeness
- [ ] Main integration diagram shows complete system
- [ ] All layers are clearly identified (User, Audio, AI/ML, Output, System)
- [ ] Color coding is meaningful and consistent
- [ ] Labels are clear and descriptive
- [ ] Flow is easy to follow

### 4. Documentation Quality
- [ ] Explanatory text accompanies diagrams
- [ ] Phase descriptions are clear (Initialization, Recording, Processing, Output)
- [ ] Cross-references to other docs are present
- [ ] File structure is logical

### 5. Integration with Existing Docs
- [ ] README.md link is correct
- [ ] References to ARCHITECTURE.md, DATA_FLOW.md are valid
- [ ] Doesn't contradict existing documentation
- [ ] Adds value (not duplicate information)

## Output

Create brief report: `/Users/mprzybyszewski/dev/ai-projects/whisper-dictation/docs/.tasks/QA_INTEGRATION_DIAGRAM_REPORT.md`

Format:

# System Integration Diagram QA Report
Date: 2025-10-10

## Summary
[1-2 paragraphs on overall quality]

## Diagram Analysis

### Main Integration Diagram
**Status**: ✅ Good / ⚠️ Issues / ❌ Critical
- Components: [check]
- Flow accuracy: [check]
- Syntax: [check]
- Clarity: [check]

[Repeat for each of 7 diagrams]

## Issues Found

### Critical (if any)
- [ ] Issue

### Minor (if any)
- [ ] Issue

## Technical Accuracy
- [ ] All components present
- [ ] Data flow correct
- [ ] Dependencies accurate
- [ ] Matches codebase

## Recommendations
[Any suggestions for improvement]

## Grade
[A+ / A / A- / B+ / etc.]

## Conclusion
[Final assessment]
```

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Count diagrams
grep -c 'mermaid' /Users/mprzybyszewski/dev/ai-projects/whisper-dictation/docs/SYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md

# Check for key components
grep -i 'DeviceManager\|Recorder\|Transcriber\|Whisper' /Users/mprzybyszewski/dev/ai-projects/whisper-dictation/docs/SYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md

# Verify README link
grep 'SYSTEM_INTEGRATION' /Users/mprzybyszewski/dev/ai-projects/whisper-dictation/docs/README.md
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 7 diagrams reviewed
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified
- [ ] Mermaid syntax checked
- [ ] Report created with specific feedback
- [ ] Grade assigned
