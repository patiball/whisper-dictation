# Task: Fix Duplicate Content in PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md

## File
`/Users/mprzybyszewski/dev/ai-projects/whisper-dictation/docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`

## Issues to Fix

### 1. Duplicate "Znane ograniczenia" Section
There are TWO sections with "Znane ograniczenia" that need to be consolidated into ONE.

**Action**: 
- Keep the more complete version
- Remove the duplicate
- Ensure all unique points from both versions are preserved

### 2. Duplicate Roadmap Sections  
There are TWO roadmap sections with different formatting styles.

**Action**:
- Consolidate into ONE authoritative roadmap
- Use consistent checkbox style (prefer emoji style: âœ… ðŸš§ ðŸ“‹)
- Merge all unique items from both versions
- Order by priority/timeline

## Instructions
1. Read the file carefully
2. Identify the duplicate sections
3. Merge them intelligently (keep all unique information)
4. Remove duplicates
5. Ensure smooth flow and readability
6. Verify no information was lost

## Verification
After changes:
```bash
# Check file is valid
grep -n "Znane ograniczenia" /Users/mprzybyszewski/dev/ai-projects/whisper-dictation/docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
# Should show only ONE occurrence

grep -n "Roadmap\|roadmap" /Users/mprzybyszewski/dev/ai-projects/whisper-dictation/docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md  
# Should show only ONE roadmap section
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Only ONE "Znane ograniczenia" section exists
- [ ] Only ONE roadmap section exists
- [ ] All unique information preserved
- [ ] Consistent formatting throughout
- [ ] File reads smoothly without redundancy
